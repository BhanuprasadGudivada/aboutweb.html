                    <p class="p-3">Touted as an extra-ordinarily talented player, Rohit Sharma is looked at by experts as a batting mainstay of Team India in the near future. Sharma made his mark at the international stage by hitting an unbeaten fifty against South Africa in the 2007 Twenty20 World Cup and a 16-ball 30 against Pakistan in the final of the tournament. In the 2008 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia, Sharma continued with his good form hitting 66 in the first final at Sydney and adding 123 runs for the fourth wicket with Sachin Tendulkar as India chased down a 240-run target in 45.5 overs. But Sharma soon lost form and with Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli scoring big, was dropped from the Indian team and was ignored for the 2011 World Cup. Sharma was set to make his Test debut in February with VVS Laxman failing to recover from an injury, but Sharma injured himself playing football in the warm-up on the first morning and missed out on his Test debut. Sharma played the first three seasons of IPL for Deccan Chargers and in the players' auction for IPL 4, he was sold for $2m to Mumbai Indians.</p>
